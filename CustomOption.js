    <!--Internally, scoped slots work by wrapping your slot 
    content in a function passed a single argument:
    That means the value of v-slot can actually accept any valid 
    JavaScript expression that can appear in the argument position 
    of a function definition. So in supported environments (single-file components or 
        modern browsers), you can also use ES2015 destructuring to pull out 
        specific slot props,  like so:

    <slot name="prepend" v-bind:option="{option}">#</slot>
